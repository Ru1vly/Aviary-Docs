# TODO: Production readiness checklist

This document outlines the remaining tasks to make the aviary checker tool production-ready.

## Known issues / fixes required
- [x] **CLI Testing**: Integration tests time out even with 120s limit (fixed by replacing slow locator auto-waits with page.evaluate).

## Core features enhancement

### SEO checkers
- [x] **Structured Data Validation**
  - [x] JSON-LD schema detection and validation
  - [x] Microdata and RDFa support
  - [x] Schema.org vocabulary validation
  - [x] Rich snippets preview

- [x] **Content Analysis**
  - [x] Keyword density analyzer
  - [x] Content readability score (Flesch-Kincaid)
  - [x] Duplicate content detection
  - [x] Word count and content length analysis
  - [x] Internal and external link analysis
  - [x] Broken link detection

- [x] **Technical SEO**
  - [x] Robots.txt validation
  - [x] XML sitemap detection and validation
  - [x] SSL/HTTPS verification
  - [x] Mobile-friendliness test
  - [x] Page speed insights integration
  - [x] Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS) — real values via `web-vitals`'/`PerformanceObserver`, injected before navigation; plus FCP and TTFB. INP itself isn't reported (it requires a real user interaction this unattended audit never performs) — Total Blocking Time (long-task entries) is the disclosed proxy instead, same as Lighthouse. See docs/ACCURACY_LIMITATIONS.md §3.4
  - [x] Server response time check
  - [x] Redirect chain detection
  - [x] 404 error detection

- [x] **Heatmap & User Experience**
  - [x] Click heatmap generation — predictive, from static DOM position/element-type heuristics, not recorded user interactions
  - [x] Scroll depth tracking
  - [ ] Mouse movement tracking — not implemented
  - [x] Attention heatmap — static heuristic scoring (heading level, above-the-fold, element size), not time-based
  - [x] Visual hierarchy analysis
  - [x] Above-the-fold content detection
      
- [x] **Social Media Optimization**
  - [x] Twitter Card validation
  - [x] Facebook Open Graph validation
  - [x] LinkedIn meta tags
  - [x] Pinterest rich pins
  - [x] Social share preview generation
        
- [x] **Accessibility (A11y)**
  - [x] ARIA attributes validation
  - [x] Color contrast checking
  - [x] Keyboard navigation testing
  - [x] Screen reader compatibility
  - [x] WCAG compliance levels

## Architecture & code quality
